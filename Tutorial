First of all u need to puy ur ships. 
Click on some cell to put one-deck ship. 
If u wanna continue ship, click around one-deck ship (only right, left, up, down). 
On the field only:
4 one-deck
3 two-deck
2 three-deck
1 four-deck

U can't to put another ship around ship.
U can't to 'break' ship like:
    *
* * *

If u put ship wrong, u can only clear all field by clicking on 'Restart'

After u put all ships start fire on the enemy field.
Enemy - bot and he fire randomly, so it is easy to win.
Good luck!
